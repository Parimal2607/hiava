Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings 2022 Calendar is here! Like everyone, appearing smart during meetings is my top priority. Sometimes this can be difficult if you start daydreaming about your next vacation, your next nap, or bacon. When this happens, it’s good to have some fallback tricks to fall back on. Here are my ten favorite tricks for quickly appearing smart during meetings. 1. Draw a Venn diagram - Getting up and drawing a Venn diagram is a great way to appear smart. It doesn’t matter if your Venn diagram is wildly inaccurate, in fact, the more inaccurate the better. Even before you’ve put that marker down, your colleagues will begin fighting about what exactly the labels should be and how big the circles should be, etc. At this point, you can slink back to your chair and go back to playing Candy Crush on your phone. 2. Translate percentage metrics into fractions - If someone says “About 25% of all users click on this button,” quickly chime in with, “So about 1 in 4,” and make a note of it. Everyone will nod their head in agreement, secretly impressed and envious of your quick math skills. 3. Encourage everyone to “take a step back” - There comes a point in most meetings where everyone is chiming in, except you. Opinions and data and milestones are being thrown around and you don’t know your CTA from your OTA. This is a great point to go, “Guys, guys, guys, can we take a step back here?” Everyone will turn their heads toward you, amazed at your ability to silence the fray. Follow it up with a quick, “What problem are we really trying to solve?” and, boom! You’ve bought yourself another hour of looking smart. 4. Nod continuously while pretending to take notes - Always bring a notepad with you. Your rejection of technology will be revered. Take notes by simply writing down one word from every sentence that you hear. Nod continuously while doing so. If someone asks you if you’re taking notes, quickly say that these are your own personal notes and that someone else should really be keeping a record of the meeting. Bravo compadre. You’ve saved your ass, and you’ve gotten out of doing any extra work. Or any work at all, if you’re truly succeeding. 5. Repeat the last thing the engineer said, but very very slowly - Make a mental note of the engineer in the room. Remember his name. He’ll be quiet throughout most of the meeting, but when his moment comes everything out of his mouth will spring from a place of unknowable brilliance. After he utters these divine words, chime in with, “Let me just repeat that,” and repeat exactly what he just said, but very, very slowly. Now, his brilliance has been transferred to you. People will look back on the meeting and mistakenly attribute the intelligent statement to you. 6. Ask “Will this scale?” no matter what it is - It’s important to find out if things will scale no matter what it is you’re discussing. No one even really knows what that means, but it’s a good catch-all question that generally applies and drives engineers nuts. 7. Pace around the room - Whenever someone gets up from the table and walks around, don’t you immediately respect them? I know I do. It takes a lot of guts but once you do it, you immediately appear smart. Fold your arms. Walk around. Go to the corner and lean against the wall. Take a deep, contemplative sigh. Trust me, everyone will be shitting their pants wondering what you’re thinking. If only they knew (bacon). 8. Ask the presenter to go back a slide - “Sorry, could you go back a slide?” They’re the seven words no presenter wants to hear. It doesn’t matter where in the presentation you shout this out, it’ll immediately make you look like you’re paying closer attention than everyone else is, because clearly they missed the thing that you’re about to brilliantly point out. Don’t have anything to point out? Just say something like, “I’m not sure what these numbers mean,” and sit back. You’ve bought yourself almost an entire meeting of appearing smart. 9. Step out for a phone call - You’re probably afraid to step out of the room because you fear people will think you aren’t making the meeting a priority. Interestingly, however, if you step out of a meeting for an “important” phone call, they’ll all realize just how busy and important you are. They’ll say, “Wow, this meeting is important, so if he has something even more important than this, well, we better not bother him.” 10. Make fun of yourself - If someone asks what you think, and you honestly didn’t hear a single word anyone said for the last hour, just say, “I honestly didn’t hear a single word anyone said for the last hour.” People love self-deprecating humor. Say things like, “Maybe we can just use the lawyers from my divorce,” or “God I wish I was dead.” They’ll laugh, value your honesty, consider contacting H.R., but most importantly, think you’re the smartest looking person in the room."\n        >\n          <div>10 Tricks to Appear Smart During Meetings</div>\n          <div class="icon-12 w-embed">\n            <svg\n              width="12"\n              height="12"\n              viewBox="0 0 12 12"\n              fill="none"\n              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"\n            >\n              <path\n                d="M6 2.5V9.5M2.5 6H9.5"\n                stroke="white"\n                stroke-width="1.5"\n                stroke-linecap="round"\n                stroke-linejoin="round"\n              ></path>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div\n          class="badge is-template-example"\n          format="Bullet points"\n          texttosummarize="Here are the 5 steps to having your best year ever by Michael Hyatt. 1. Confront Limiting Beliefs - When it comes to deciding what we really want and then writing those goals down, we may run into obstacles in our own mind. A key step toward meeting goals is confronting these limiting beliefs. Whenever we start to dream and think about the future, there are things that will come up that are merely mental constructs that keep us from moving toward our goals. Unless we challenge those thoughts and beliefs, we will never be able to achieve what we want. Rather than staying stuck in a defeated pattern of thinking, remind yourself of all that you can do! You can become better with money. You can learn how to manage it. You can become better at running a business. There are certain limiters that disappear once you identify them and realize the obstacle isn’t necessarily so big, it is simply a pre-conceived notion or belief that needs to be challenged and replaced with new thoughts and beliefs. Don’t cut off your dream before you even let it begin to bloom. Take those limiting beliefs and turn them into liberating truths instead! To do this, you need to identify them, get them out of your mind and put them on paper.  The process of writing down a limiting belief is scary because you may not even want to admit it is there in your mind. We hide those things. But being real with it and writing something down brings it to light. Revealing those thoughts and fears help us to know what is holding us back. Identifying that narrative is the first step in moving from that place toward where you want to go instead. Michael Hyatt shares there’s this narrator that lives inside of our head that is basically interpreting life. The narrative we create is the difference between what we experience and the meaning we slap on it. If you decouple those, you can begin to objectify the experience. When we do that, we can identify limiting beliefs attached to that story, get them out of the way, begin to believe in the future, and move towards something better. 2. Complete the Past - As we look back and rewrite our beliefs, we will inevitably come up against stories from our past. We have all experienced setbacks, challenges, and things that were discouraging in life.  These things must be processed. If you don’t, you drag the worst of the past into the best of your future. Getting stuck like that can alter your perception and limit your ability to dream. 3. Design your Future - Once we intentionally process our past experiences and create new beliefs, we can then move toward the future. Designing our future is where we pivot from the world of limiting beliefs and the past and instead look forward to the future that hasn’t been created yet. It is a blank canvas, which is a gift that God gives to us every year. In designing our future, we can choose a SMARTER framework than we may have used before. This is how: SMARTER Framework: S stands for SPECIFIC. Sometimes, we don’t achieve the goals that we set out to achieve because we’re not being specific enough. M is for MEASURABLE. If you can attach a number to your goal and quantify it, it makes it more powerful and gives you the ability to track your progress. A stands for ACTIONABLE. This means your goal needs to start with a verb, but not just any old verb, it needs to be an action verb like eliminate, lose, gain, achieve, or something similar. R stands for REALISTIC. The problem with being realistic is that it is overrated. The goal achievement research says that you’re less likely to achieve realistic goals because they’re not that interesting, so the key is choosing goals that inspire you but turning them into realistic steps. T stands for TIME-BOUND, and that just means put a date on it. Set a timeframe for each step you intend to take. That alone helps hold you accountable for progress toward that date. E stands for EXCITING. The goal should be exciting enough for you to pursue it. Again, we need goals that come from our heart and our passion – from our new beliefs about what we truly want separate and apart from past beliefs and negative narratives. Our goals should inspire us. Finally, R stands for RELEVANT. Goals must be relevant to your values. Goals that inspire and motivate must align with what matters most to us. Relevant goals cannot contradict your fundamental values. 4. Find your WHY - As you write down SMARTER goals, you also need to identify your why. Why are these goals important to you? Why do they matter so much?  Often when moving toward goals, people lose their way when they lose their WHY. As you articulate each of the goals you identify as important to you, figure out your two or three top reasons for wanting to achieve that goal. Think about what is at stake, why it is important, and what you gain when you achieve it. And this is something where you really need to dig deep, says Hyatt. You have to really dive into this because when you get to the messy middle, your why is what is going to pull you through. 5. Make It Happen - Another thing to remember as you move toward you best year ever is realizing that you don’t have to know every step from today until two years from now. You just need the next key step or two. As you move toward your goals, the best way to gain clarity and passion to get you through the discomfort zone, is by putting your goal in motion. Moving toward it will help you gain momentum to get out of your comfort zone. Michael says you really just have to get started and just know it’s going to lead you where you need to go. As you move forward, you will gain confidence and further clarity that will get you past the discomfort zone. Think About What You Want in Life - If you’re reading this, you are likely in a position to want more from your life than you are currently experiencing. Getting real about what you truly want is crucial. Most people go through life just drifting. Many people felt this way during the pandemic, as if they lost their way. They feel directionless. The problem with this numbed out state of drift is that nobody ever drifted to a destination they have chosen. When you’re drifting, you end up at challenging places, places you never intended to be. The alternative to drifting is to design the future YOU want. Decide where you want to go and why. Don’t just drift into the future, says Hyatt, rather design the future you want and move toward it deliberately."\n        >\n          <div>5 Steps to your Best Year Ever</div>\n          <div class="icon-12 w-embed">\n            <svg\n              width="12"\n              height="12"\n              viewBox="0 0 12 12"\n              fill="none"\n              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"\n            >\n              <path\n                d="M6 2.5V9.5M2.5 6H9.5"\n                stroke="white"\n                stroke-width="1.5"\n                stroke-linecap="round"\n                stroke-linejoin="round"\n              ></path>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      <div class="welcome-message_examples">\n        <div\n          class="badge is-template-example"\n          format="Bullet points"\n          texttosummarize="Slack’s $25 Billion Dollar Secret Sauce: How Slack stole a multi-billion dollar market by becoming everyone’s favorite sassy robot sidekick. “So what’s the secret behind Slack? What did you guys do that was so special?” the voice crackled over my car’s Bluetooth, “I want you guys to do whatever you did for them.” I was on a call with a prospective client, the CEO of a successful SaaS app who wanted to hire us to redesign his product. I launched into a story that I’ve told hundreds of times. In almost ten years of business, Slack is, without a doubt, our most successful project to date — and we’ve worked with some big names. It’s now valued at $2.8 billion, has over 200,000 paying users, and our favourite part: people can’t stop talking about its great design. But I wouldn’t have predicted that going into it. When you hear people talk about Slack they often say it’s “fun”. Using it doesn’t feel like work. It feels like slacking off, even when you’re using it to get stuff done. But when you look under the hood, it’s almost identical to every other chat app. You can create a room, add people, share files, and chat as a group or direct message one another. So, what makes Slack different? Three key things. Zeroing in on the branding (2013) - It Looks Different. To get attention in a crowded market, we had to find a way to get people’s attention. Most enterprise software looks like a cheap 70\'s prom suit — muted blues and greys everywhere — so, starting with the logo, we made Slack look like a confetti cannon had gone off. Electric blue, yellows, purples, and greens all over. We gave it the color scheme of a video game, not an enterprise collaboration product. It Feels Different - Slack is also chock full of fun little interactions. The logo animates in a burst of colors as it loads; modals slide down from the top of the screen; changing teams flips the screen around like a deck of cards. Throughout the entire product, everything seems to playfully jump around and pop off the screen. Each of these interactions is designed not only to help the user understand what’s going on, but put a little smile on their face. “We gave it the color scheme of a video game, not an enterprise collaboration product.” Have you ever walked into a house and had an indescribable feeling that it just feels cheap? A professional builder would walk in and give you a laundry list of shortcomings: uneven drywall, gappy hardwood floors, hollow-core doors, and cheap hardware. But most people just have a gut reaction. Like a well-built home, great software focuses on giving its users hundreds of small, satisfying interactions. A great transition in a mobile app gives us the same feeling we get from using a well-made door handle on a solid oak door — you may not be able to put your finger on it, but man, does the house ever feel well built. Slack is really fun to use. It feels like a well-built house. It Sounds Different. But it’s not just how Slack looks and feels, it’s also about what it says. In Slack, every piece of copy is seen as an opportunity to be playful. Where a competitor might just have a loading spinner, Slack has funny quotes like, “Need to whip up a dessert in a hurry? Dump a bag of oreos on the floor and eat the oreos off the floor like an animal.” A strange little injection of fun into an otherwise boring day. Slack acts like your wise-cracking robot sidekick, instead of the boring enterprise chat tool it would otherwise be. Even Slack’s Twitter account sounds more like an emoji-loving comedian than a billion dollar enterprise software company. Slack’s secret sauce is no different. Sure, it’s hard to get the mix of ingredients just right, but it doesn’t have any features that others can’t build. It’s the same enterprise chat client underneath, but it’s playful, fun to use, and all that comes together to make it feel like a character in your life."\n        >\n          <div>Slack’s $25 Billion Dollar Secret Sauce</div>\n          <div class="icon-12 w-embed">\n            <svg\n              width="12"\n              height="12"\n              viewBox="0 0 12 12"\n              fill="none"\n              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"\n            >\n              <path\n                d="M6 2.5V9.5M2.5 6H9.5"\n                stroke="white"\n                stroke-width="1.5"\n                stroke-linecap="round"\n                stroke-linejoin="round"\n              ></path>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>`\n]',

      "(function returnPrompt() {\n  return `Your task is to craft a compelling introduction for a blog post titled. The introduction should consist of three paragraphs that captivate and inform the reader. The first paragraph should include the blog post title. It’s recommended to use an engaging question that sparks the reader's curiosity. For example: “\"Sachin Tendulkar is one of the greatest batsmen of all time, no doubt about it! But do you know he even got the top spot in Wisden’s list this year?\".\n\nThe second paragraph should have the exact answer in short. You must write a brief of the article within three sentences in the second para for example if the article is regarding “Greatest Batsmen,” you should design the second paragraph like “Sachin, with 100+ centuries and more than 30K career runs in total, is truly the greatest batsman of all time. Indian batsmen Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli come next on the line with 15k and 12k runs, respectively.\"\n\nThe third paragraph should draw the reader to the main article. Use hooks. For example, “But these are not the only three batsmen we have in this year’s ranking. So, without any further ado, let’s jump into the realm of the greatest batters the world has ever seen this year.” \n\nWhen writing your introduction, avoid passive sentences, repetitive statements, and long sentences. Instead, opt for short, crisp sentences that convey your message effectively. Lastly, engage your readers by asking thought-provoking questions that prompt them to share their thoughts and opinions.\n\nWrite the introduction an article with this topic/content: ${post_title}\n\n${post_content ? 'Additional details for the article:' + post_content : ''}\n${target_audience ? 'Target audience for article:' + target_audience : ''}\n\n`;\n})();\n",

Despite persistent negative effects from the Covid-19 pandemic, we generated a group result after tax of 4.6 billion euro. This marks a substantial increase in comparison to the prior-year result of 2.6 billion euro. The group result after tax is significantly influenced by the result from the investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity of 4.6 billion euro, after 2.7 billion euro in the prior year. Net liquidity of the Porsche SE Group amounted to 641 million euro as of 31 December 2021, compared to 563 million euro end of 2020. Our core investment, Volkswagen AG, has demonstrated remarkable robustness in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the global semiconductor shortage had an increasingly negative impact on business figures in the second half of 2021, Volkswagen advanced its transformation into a software-driven mobility provider. The next stage of this transformation is to follow: By providing positive support for a possible IPO of Porsche AG, Porsche SE is supporting an expansion of the financial flexibility of Volkswagen AG and, at the same time, an increase in the entrepreneurial opportunities of Porsche AG. Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG have entered into a cornerstone agreement. In connection with a possible IPO, Porsche SE would acquire 25 percent plus one share of the ordinary shares of Porsche AG from Volkswagen AG. Volkswagen would use the proceeds from a possible IPO of Porsche AG to finance the industrial and technological transformation of the Volkswagen Group as well as for further growth. In the course of the further development of PTV, we were able to win a strong partner in the private equity company Bridgepoint Advisers, which acquired a majority shareholding in PTV. Porsche SE retains a significant stake in the company. Together with Bridgepoint, we aim to continue to drive the growth of PTV. Porsche SE received a cash flow of around 240 million euro from this transaction, which will be used for further investments in the mobility and industrial technology sector as part of our investment strategy. There were also additional positive developments. AEVA and Markforged completed successful IPOs. In July 2021, we made a new investment in Isar Aerospace, a start-up from Munich that develops and produces carrier rockets for transporting satellites. In September 2021, we also acquired a share in the Israeli company protean Tecs, whose technology enables function and performance monitoring of semiconductors and electronic systems."\n      class="badge is-template-example"\n    >\n      <div>Porsche</div>\n      <div class="icon-12 w-embed">\n        <svg\n          width="12"\n          height="12"\n          viewBox="0 0 12 12"\n          fill="none"\n          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"\n        >\n          <path\n            d="M6 2.5V9.5M2.5 6H9.5"\n            stroke="white"\n            stroke-width="1.5"\n            stroke-linecap="round"\n            stroke-linejoin="round"\n          ></path>\n        </svg>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div\n      financialsummary="Automobili Lamborghini concluded the financial year 2021 with the best results ever in terms of sales, turnover and profitability, confirming a solid and winning strategy. Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini, commented: “Lamborghini has delivered excellent commercial and financial results, the best in its history, which give the company the necessary solidity to navigate a new period of uncertainty like the present one. We are deeply saddened by what is happening in Ukraine and hope for a swift end to the hostilities in the name of democratic values.” Turnover reached the all-time high of 1.95 billion euros, a 19% increase over 2020. Efficient management supported by the launch of new models drove operating profit to a level never previously seen. The operating margin more than doubled compared to 2018 and reached 20.2%, a profitability level in line with the luxury industry. This excellent performance translates into an operating income of 393 million euros, up by a massive 49% compared to 2020 (264 million euros). As part of an ambitious strategic plan to include the highest investment in the company’s history (1.8 billion euros over the next five years, entirely self-financed), Lamborghini has its eyes on an even more challenging financial goal for the upcoming years: to push up its profitability to between 22% and 25%. 2021 was also the best year ever on a commercial level, with 8,405 cars delivered globally (+13% compared to 2020). Overall, the three macro-regions where Lamborghini can be found grew by double digits: America (+14%), Asia Pacific (+14%) and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa, +12%), in which 34%, 27%, and 39% of global volumes, respectively, are evenly divided. Alongside these positive results, Lamborghini wanted to give a concrete sign of support to the Ukrainian population affected by the latest tragic events. The company arranged for a donation of €500,000 to UNHCR – the United Nations refugee agency – which has been working in Ukraine since 2014. This gesture of solidarity was accompanied by the decision to suspend business in Russia.Paolo Poma, Managing Director and CFO of Automobili Lamborghini, added: “In recent years we have demonstrated that we have the potential and the ability to work towards excellent financial results, even when facing an exogenous variable of enormous impact such as the pandemic. The current geopolitical situation requires constant monitoring of the impact on the global economy, but we will take all necessary measures to safeguard our strategy, based on development of the next generation of products and supported by a major investment plan that will guide our growth path, further improving our financial performance, the value of our brand and our company.” With regard to sales, the United States held on to the top spot (2,472 units, +11%), followed by China leaping into second place (935, +55%), Germany (706, +16%) and the United Kingdom (564, +9%). Lamborghini also witnessed an increase in its home market, Italy: +4%, with a total of 359 vehicles delivered. In terms of models, there was success for the Urus Super SUV with 5,021 units delivered, followed by the V10-powered Huracán, which saw a huge increase in sales to 2,586 units generated by the strong impetus provided by the Huracán STO. In addition, 798 Aventadors (V12 model) were delivered across the world. In the coming months, Lamborghini will unveil innovations for the Huracán and Urus, two for each model, to then conclude the age of internal combustion engines and move on to hybridization, commencing with the arrival of the model replacing the Aventador in 2023. In the year just ended Lamborghini announced its ambitious Direzione Cor Tauri strategy, named after the brightest star in the constellation of Taurus. It will be a two-phase path to an electric future while remaining true to the brand’s DNA. In the first phase, the transition to hybrid, the company will introduce its first model with hybrid technology in 2023 before going on to complete the hybridization of the entire range by 2024 and achieve a 50% cut in CO2 emissions. The last phase, complete electrification, will start in the second half of the decade, with the introduction of a fourth model, that will be fully electric, to sit alongside the hybrid line-up."\n      class="badge is-template-example"\n    >\n      <div>Lamborghini</div>\n      <div class="icon-12 w-embed">\n        <svg\n          width="12"\n          height="12"\n          viewBox="0 0 12 12"\n          fill="none"\n          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"\n        >\n          <path\n            d="M6 2.5V9.5M2.5 6H9.5"\n            stroke="white"\n            stroke-width="1.5"\n            stroke-linecap="round"\n            stroke-linejoin="round"\n          ></path>\n        </svg>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n` ]\n',
